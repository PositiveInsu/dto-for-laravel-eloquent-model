## Overview

Data Transfer Object (DTO) is a simple object to hold the data from Laravel Eloquent Model
or Collection.

Laravel eloquent Model object handles data with an array; it is an easy and flexible way to handle the data.
On the contrary, when we use the Model object, we have to reference the target Model object's fillable fields 
or databases to understand what is inside. 
Luckily, If you use the Debug tool, it gives more detailed information to you. 
But anyway, it is hard to know what data Model handles when you write the code.

I developed this code for reducing this uncomfortable situation.
Data Transfer Object allow PHP Laravel developer to use Model more clearly and way of OOP.
